A program that converts images to mindustry sorters schematic

instruction to use this program:
 - start program by running `gui.py` (or if u on windows you can download executable from releases).
 - insert path of image you want to convert to `Source image`. (you can use `Browse` button)
 - edit `piece width` and `piece height` if you want not standart width and
   height of resulting schematics. (you can get more than one)
   if size is very big[more than 32] mindustry may lag when you will building it
 - edit `schematic width` and `schematic height` to change resolution of 
   final sorter art.
 - edit `schematic name` if you want different name of resulting schematics
 - check output location(directory that shown under `schematic name` field and `Export` button)
   this is place where all art pieces (schematics) will be saved.
 - click `Export` to generate and save schmetics.
 - wait until word `done` will appear in console. (there also will appear error list, but ignore it)

After that open your mindustry, enter sector where you want to place art
open schematics menu, import schematic, find "output location" and import
all these schematics, they are pieces of your art (there can be more than one)

after importing you can build them whenever you want, also you will see
numbers on each schematic, this is hint that tells you where to put piece
